Hotel Booking Demand – Data Cleaning Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing of the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to explore, understand, and prepare the raw data for future analysis or machine learning by removing unnecessary noise and making it cleaner, more readable, and structured.

This was my first complete data cleaning project, built entirely with Python and Pandas.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the dataset structure and column meanings.

Clean and rename poorly formatted or unclear columns.

Remove redundant or unnecessary columns to simplify the dataset.

Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

Prepare the data for further analysis or visualization.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

VS Code

🔍 Key Learnings & Insights

Many column names were long or unclear — renaming them made the dataset more readable and professional.

Several columns carried similar or unnecessary information; reducing them improved dataset clarity.

Data cleaning made me realize how messy real-world data is, and how crucial preprocessing is before any ML model or visualization.

The dataset gave insights into hotel performance — both city and resort hotels were operating normally, but data cleaning revealed patterns that could later be explored for booking trends, cancellations, and customer behavior.

📈 Next Steps

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to visualize patterns like booking cancellations, seasonality, and average stay duration.

Explore feature engineering to make this dataset ML-ready.

Continue improving data documentation and analysis reporting (especially writing insights clearly).

💬 Final Note

This was my first practical project in data cleaning, and it taught me how small details — like naming columns, removing redundancy, and structuring information — can completely change how readable and usable a dataset becomes.

The journey has just started — but every cleaned dataset is one step closer to mastery.
